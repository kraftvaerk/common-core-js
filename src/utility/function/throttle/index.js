/**
 * Creates a function that, when executed, will only call
 * the fn function at most once per every interval milliseconds.
 *
 * throttle(fn, interval):Function
 *
 * If the throttled function is invoked more than once during the
 * wait timeout, fn will also be called on the trailing edge of the timeout.
 *
 * Subsequent calls to the throttled function will return the result of the last fn call.
 *
 * EX:
 * var lazyRedraw = throttle(redraw, 300);
 * foo.on.resize.add(lazyRedraw);
 *
 * lazyRedraw();
 * setTimeout(function(){
 *      lazyRedraw();
 *
 *      lazyRedraw will be called only once since 'cancel' was called before
 *      the 'interval' for 2nd call completed
 *
 *      lazyRedraw.cancel();
 * }, 250);
